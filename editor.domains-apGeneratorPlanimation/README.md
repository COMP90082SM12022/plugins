# Animation PDDL Generator plugin

This folder contains the plugin for http://editor.planning.domains.
This plugin complements the Planimation plugin by helping the user to generate the animation profile needed for planimation.

## Functionality
 - This pulgin is similar to the pddl generator plugin existing in editor.planning.domains, can add built in generators for different visualizations that are common in planning, which can help the user to write Animation Profile to visualise the planning problem. 

## How to use this plugin

1. Go to http://editor.planning.domains
2. Click plugin on the top menu and install Animation PDDL Generator plugin.
3. Wait the Animation PDDL Generator plugin is fully loaded.
4. We provide snippets for autocompletion of animation PDDL syntax,
5. and GUI for generating the 3 most common syntax (predicate, visual, image). The GUI can extract the infomation from the existing domian files to help writing animation profile, and converting uploaded images to be encoded with base64 style.
6. Then install Planimation plugin, upload domain, problem, animation profile to animation planning question.

## Futher Improvement 
1. Snippet can be implemented in the GUI.
